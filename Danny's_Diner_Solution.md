### Rank All The Things - Danny also requires further information about the ```ranking``` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ```ranking``` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

````sql
WITH NEW_TABLE AS(
SELECT s.customer_id, order_date, product_name, price,
	CASE WHEN join_date <= order_date THEN 'Y'
	ELSE 'N'
	END as member
FROM sales s
LEFT JOIN menu m
on s.product_id = m.product_id
LEFT JOIN members  ms
on s.customer_id = ms.customer_id
)

SELECT *, CASE WHEN member = 'N' THEN NULL 
			   ELSE RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY CUSTOMER_ID, member order by order_date) 
			   END as Rankings
FROM NEW_TABLE;
````
